PIPELINE ALNFantasia_World_OmniBranch_Engine
# Purpose: Enables dynamic, recursive, and always-active branching workflows for world, region, event, and system.
# This engine auto-creates/join/forks workflows live; any event can branch ANY number of subflows, with error/no-op fallback to keep system alive.
