# 🛡️ Doctor0Evil — Bit.Hub / ALNFantasia Compliance & Rescue Hub

> **Mission:** Build a self-governing, fail‑open, personality‑driven platform where every runner, workflow, and creative asset stays compliant with our community guidelines — even when “lost” in the wild.

---

## 📜 Overview

This repository is the **nerve center** for Bit.Hub and ALNFantasia’s compliance, rescue, and creative orchestration systems.  
It blends **governance manifests**, **game‑world logic**, and **self‑healing automation** to ensure that:

- All GitHub runners and independent VM clusters operate under our **conceptual framework**.
- Workflows are **silently repaired, renamed, and brought into compliance** without blocking builds.
- `.bit.coin` tokens track **personality vectors**, compliance history, and creative merit.
- Game‑development tools, lore systems, and AI logic modules remain **mature, profane‑capable, and policy‑gated**.

---

## 🧩 Core Components

### `.gitrescue` & `.gitlost`
- **Purpose:** Detect and correct “lost” workflows/runners.
- **Behavior:** Fail‑open, log repairs, commit silently if possible.
- **Repairs:**  
  - Scaffold missing compliance walls.  
  - Rehome misplaced workflows.  
  - Normalize runner configs.  
  - Issue ephemeral `.bit.coin` tokens if missing.

### `.bit.coin` — Data Currency & Personality Anchor
- **Type:** Non‑fungible, data‑backed personality token.
- **Uses:** Rewarding compliant runs, gating content, staking in‑game assets.
- **Personality Vectors:** Banter level, profanity tolerance, reputation, compliance score, quirkiness.
- **Storage:** Anchored in Bit.Hub’s blockchain subsystem with immutable compliance tags.

### Compliance Wall
- **Workflow Harness:** `.github/workflows/bithub-bot-compliance-wall.yml`
- **Function:** Pre‑job policy sync, identity verification, auto‑repair, audit logging.
- **Mode:** Always‑successful (fail‑open) with visible Terms of Service in job summaries.

### Game / AI Modules
- **Faction_Economy.cpp** — Economic simulation for ALNFantasia factions.
- **ALN_GIS_MoodEngine.lisp** — Mood‑driven rendering and NPC behavior.
- **renderer_sub_frame.lua** — Sub‑frame rendering logic for immersive effects.
- **aln_gore_debug_and_laugh.aln** — Debugging with humor hooks.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Rescue Pass**  
   `.gitrescue` / `.gitlost` scans the repo for drift, missing files, or non‑canonical names.
2. **Repair & Rename**  
   Workflows are silently renamed per `.bit/rename.map` and injected with compliance banners.
3. **Compliance Harness**  
   Every job runs through the harness, syncing manifests and enforcing `.bit.coin` rules.
4. **Audit & Celebrate**  
   All actions are logged to `.bit/audit/` and summarized in the CI job output.  
   Success is celebrated — even if repairs were needed.

🧠 Philosophy
Fail‑Open, Fix‑Forward: Never block creative or build flow — repair and log instead.

Visible Governance: Terms and compliance status are always evident in CI summaries.

Personality‑Infused: Tokens and workflows carry personality vectors that shape both platform and game‑world behavior.

Federated Evolution: Policies and manifests evolve via fan.asia tools across all clusters.
